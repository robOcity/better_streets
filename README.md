# Pedestrian and Cyclist Safety

## Motivation

In 2018, Bicycling magazine rated Seattle the countries best city for cyclists.  Denver, the city I live in, dropped three positions to 14.  Cyclist safety is an [issue](https://denverite.com/2019/07/31/traffic-deaths-are-having-a-moment-in-denver-its-the-latest-in-a-scroll-of-preventable-deaths/) here in Denver.  I count my self lucky that I am able to ride my bike to work.  Yet, with cyclist fatalities in the news, I wondered how do Denver and Seattle compare in terms of cyclist and pedestrian fatalities?  And, how have those trends changed over time?   This project aims to answer these questions.



## Goals

1. Analyze the number of fatal traffic accidents per capita, how they have varied over time, and compare the rates in Denver, Colorado and Seattle, Washington.  

1. Investigate the number of pedestrian and bicycle accidents that occur after dark in Denver and Seattle.  

1. Plot the distribution of pedestrian and bicycle accidents as a function of speed limit.  



## Per capita pedestrain and cyclist fatality rates



## Does lighting conditions a factor?



## Data Sources

To meet these goals, I am relying on the follow data sets.

You can find the documention [here](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/#/DocumentTypeList/23) and three reports in particular were especially important for my analysis:
